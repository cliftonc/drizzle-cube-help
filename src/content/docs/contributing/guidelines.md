```bash
git clone https://github.com/cliftonc/drizzle-cube.git
cd drizzle-cube
```

### <a name="repository-structure"></a> Repository structure

- 📂 `src/`

  Core library source code

  - 📂 `server/` - Server-side semantic layer implementation
  - 📂 `client/` - React components and hooks for analytics UI
  - 📂 `adapters/` - Framework adapters (Hono, Express, Fastify, Next.js)

- 📂 `tests/`

  Comprehensive test suite with multi-database support

- 📂 `dev/`

  Development environment with example implementation, so you can test your changes with HMR.

- 📂 `docs/`

  Documentation and implementation plans when using tools like Claude Code (we encourage this).

- 📂 `../drizzle-cube-*/`

  Example projects demonstrating different framework integrations are in separate github repositories.
  - `drizzle-cube-express/` - Express.js example
  - `drizzle-cube-fastify/` - Fastify example
  - `drizzle-cube-hono/` - Hono example
  - `drizzle-cube-nextjs/` - Next.js example
  - `drizzle-cube-try-site/` - Interactive sandbox
  - `drizzle-cube-help-site/` - Main documentation site

### <a name="building-the-project"></a> Building the project

Run the following script from the root folder to build the project:

```bash
npm install && npm run build
```
To setup postgres and seed with sample data:

```
npm run dev:setup
```

Then for development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then to run the tests (default uses Postgres):

```bash
npm t
```

## <a name="commit-message-guidelines"></a> Commit message guidelines

We have specific rules on how commit messages should be structured.

It's important to make sure your commit messages are clear, concise, and informative to make it easier for others to understand the changes you are making.

All commit messages should follow the pattern below:

```
<subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
```

Example:

```
Add PostgreSQL array support to measures

Enables aggregation functions on PostgreSQL array columns
for more flexible analytics queries
```

> [!WARNING]
> All commits should be signed before submitting a PR. Please check the documentation on [how to sign commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification).

## <a name="contributing-core"></a> Contributing to the core library

### <a name="project-structure-core"></a> Project structure

- 📂 `src/server/`
  
  Server-side semantic layer with type-safe query building, SQL generation, and security

- 📂 `src/client/`

  React components, hooks, and utilities for building analytics dashboards

- 📂 `src/adapters/`

  Framework-specific adapters that integrate the semantic layer with web frameworks

### <a name="running-tests-core"></a> Running tests

All tests for Drizzle Cube are integration tests that simulate real databases with different queries and responses. Each test file covers different scenarios for different dialects and drivers. Tests create Docker containers with the needed databases and run test cases there. After every test is run, the Docker container is deleted.

If you have added additional logic to the core library, make sure that all tests complete without any failures.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have added data types, query features, or new functionality, you need to create additional test cases using the new API to ensure it works properly.

**Setup test databases via docker:**

```bash
npm run test:setup
```

**Run default postgres tests:**

```bash
npm test
```

**Run database-specific tests:**

```bash
# PostgreSQL (default)
npm run test:postgres

# MySQL
npm run test:mysql

# SQLite
npm run test:sqlite

# All databases
npm run test:all
```

**Run tests in watch mode:**

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

**Teardown test databases:**

```bash
npm run test:teardown
```

### <a name="pr-guidelines-core"></a> PR guidelines

1. PR titles should follow the pattern below:

   ```
   [<area>]: <subject>
   ```

   Examples:

   ```
   [Server] Add MySQL JSON field support
   [Client] Improve chart type selection UX  
   [Adapters] Add Fastify CORS configuration
   ```

2. PRs should contain a detailed description of everything that was changed.

3. Commit messages should follow the [message style guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines).

4. PRs should implement:
   - Tests for features that were added.
   - Tests for bugs that were fixed.
   - Type checking with `npm run typecheck`
   - Linting with `npm run lint`

> [!NOTE]
> To understand how tests should be created and run, please check the [Running tests](#running-tests-core) section.

## <a name="contributing-examples"></a> Contributing to examples

Example projects are located in separate github repositories and follow the same contribution guidelines:

- [drizzle-cube-express](https://github.com/cliftonc/drizzle-cube-express) - Express.js with React dashboard
- [drizzle-cube-fastify](https://github.com/cliftonc/drizzle-cube-fastify) - Fastify with React dashboard  
- [drizzle-cube-hono](https://github.com/cliftonc/drizzle-cube-hono) - Hono with React dashboard
- [drizzle-cube-nextjs](https://github.com/cliftonc/drizzle-cube-nextjs) - Next.js full-stack application

When contributing to examples:

1. Ensure examples use the latest version of the core library
2. Update documentation if adding new features to examples
3. Test examples work with multiple databases where applicable
4. Keep examples simple and focused on demonstrating specific features

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork and clone** the repository
2. **Create a branch** for your feature/fix
3. **Set up development environment:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev:setup  # Sets up dev database
   ```
4. **Make your changes** with appropriate tests
5. **Run the test suite:**
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   npm run lint
   npm run test:all
   ```
6. **Create a pull request** with a clear description

## Architecture Guidelines

**Drizzle-First Design**: This project is built around Drizzle ORM as the core:
- All SQL generation must use Drizzle query builder
- Never use string concatenation for SQL
- All database operations go through Drizzle
- Type safety is enforced through Drizzle schema definitions

**Security**: SQL injection prevention is paramount:
- Use parameterized queries only
- Leverage Drizzle's type safety
- Include security context in all cube definitions
- Test multi-tenant isolation
